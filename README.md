# Coffee for devs (This is a dummy project from DevChallenges.io)

DevChallenges.io is a valuable platform that provides real-life coding projects to help individuals improve their skills and become proficient software engineers. It offers a range of career paths and challenges for different skill levels, allowing users to practice coding, enhance their abilities, and build an outstanding portfolio.

At this particular project on devChallenges.io, I have the opportunity to practice translating a design into code. This involves taking a visual design or mockup and implementing it using HTML, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript (In my case).

In addition to translating the design, this project also involves consuming a JSON file.

Another aspect of this project is conditional rendering. Conditional rendering allows you to control the display of certain elements based on specific conditions or states. By utilizing TypeScript and a state management (useState hook from react) approach, I dynamically render specific content based on whether a certain condition is met. In the context of this project, you can render different coffee options depending on their availability.

For this project I use React-vite with TailwindCSS and TypeScript.
